    biography: `Katherine Johnson led an extraordinary life. Born in 1918 in White Sulpher Springs, West Virginia, she grew up grades ahead of her peers in school. She excelled in mathematics in college and graduated with the highest honors in 1937, taking a job teaching at a black public school in Virginia afterward. When West Virginia finally decided to quietly desegregate its schools, she was one of three black students to integrate West Virginia’s graduate schools. She enrolled in the graduate mathematics program at West Virginia University.

    In 1952, a relative told her about open positions at the all-black West Area Computing section at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics’ (NACA’s) Langley laboratory Led by Dorothy Vaughn. NACA soon became NASA after the 1957 launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik. At NASA, Katherine did trajectory analysis for Alan Shepard’s May 1961 mission Freedom 7, America’s first human spaceflight. In 1960, she made history as the first woman in the Flight Research Division that had received credit as an author of a research report. The report, coauthored with Ted Skopinski laid out the equations describing an orbital spaceflight in which the landing position of the spacecraft is specified. 
    
    In 1962, as NASA prepared for the orbital mission of John Glenn, Katherine was personally called upon by Glenn to ensure his safety by recalculating and rechecking flight trajectories that had already been programmed into the computer. Glenn’s flight was a success, and turned the tide of the Space Race. 
    
    Her calculations were also critical to the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the moon. For her incredible contributions to space exploration in her 30 years at NASA, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama, America's highest civilian honor.

    biography: `Ada Lovelace was a countess, English mathematician and writer, most recognized for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is regarded as the world's first computer programmer for her publication in 1843, suggesting the data input that would program the Analytic Machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, now considered the first computer program. Babbage was so impressed, he dubbed her the "Enchantress of Numbers".

    Beyond understanding the intricacies of Babbage's machine, Ada Lovelace was a visionary. She predicted what would happen 100 years in the future, that machines like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, create graphics, and would be vital for scientific progress. She understood that numbers could be used to represent so much more than just quantities. Lovelace became a brilliant mathematician, thanks in part to opportunities that were denied most women of the time. Born into aristocracy, the daughter of famous poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke, she was already destined for the history books. But her curiosity about how society relates to technology as a collaborative tool and contributions to the field of mathematics made her a pioneer.

    biography: `Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and US Navy Rear Admiral. She's often referred to as the Admiral of the Cybersea or "Amazing Grace" for her many computing innovations. After earning her PhD in mathematics from Yale in 1934, she enlisted in the Navy and graduated first in her class and began working on the Mark I computer. In 1949, she recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words, but was told very quickly that she couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English. Her idea wasn't accepted for 3 years. But by 1952, she had an operational compiler, A-0. That shut down the naysayers. A compiler is a computer program that converts code written in a language that programmers can understand to 0s and 1s for the computer to understand. She is also known for popularizing the term "computer bug" after she found an actual moth trapped in the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator and deemed the machine "debugged" after retrieving the insect. Grace also developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components for early programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN.

    Her awards are many including the National Medal of Technology and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The USS Hopper, nicknamed Amazing Grace is on a very short list of US military vessels named after women. A few days ago Yale announced that it is renaming Calhoun College after her. Grace Hopper believed in taking chances and the potential of young people. To quote her: the most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people.
